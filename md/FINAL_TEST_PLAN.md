# Final Test Plan for CRUD Activity Logging

## Issue Summary

CRUD operations are not being logged in the activity logs. Only LOGIN activities are showing up.

## Test Steps

### 1. Start the Server

```bash
cd Server
npm run dev
```

### 2. Test Regular Admin CRUD Operations

#### Step 2.1: Login as Regular Admin

1. Open the client application
2. Login with a regular admin account (NOT superadmin)
3. Note: This should create a LOGIN activity log

#### Step 2.2: Perform CRUD Operations

1. **Create a User**:

   - Go to User Management
   - Click "Add New User"
   - Fill in the form and submit
   - This should create a CREATE activity log

2. **Update a User**:

   - Go to User Management
   - Edit an existing user
   - Save changes
   - This should create an UPDATE activity log

3. **Delete a User**:

   - Go to User Management
   - Delete a user
   - This should create a DELETE activity log

4. **Create/Update/Delete MDA**:
   - Repeat similar operations for MDAs
   - Each should create corresponding activity logs

### 3. Check Activity Logs

#### Step 3.1: Login as Superadmin

1. Logout from regular admin
2. Login as superadmin
3. Navigate to Activity Logs page

#### Step 3.2: Verify Logs

You should see:

- ✅ Regular admin LOGIN activity
- ✅ CREATE USER activity
- ✅ UPDATE USER activity
- ✅ DELETE USER activity
- ✅ CREATE/UPDATE/DELETE MDA activities
- ❌ NO superadmin LOGIN activity (should be filtered out)

## Expected Behavior

### What Should Be Logged:

- Regular admin login/logout
- All CRUD operations by regular admins
- All CRUD operations by superadmins (but filtered from display)

### What Should NOT Be Logged:

- Superadmin login/logout
- GET requests (read operations)
- Failed operations (non-2xx status codes)

### What Should Be Displayed:

- Only regular admin activities
- Superadmin activities should be filtered out from display

## Troubleshooting

### If CRUD Operations Are Not Logged:

1. **Check Server Console**:

   - Look for "Activity Logger: No admin info available" messages
   - Look for "Failed to log activity" error messages

2. **Check Database**:

   - Connect to MongoDB
   - Check the `activities` collection
   - Verify if activities are being saved but not displayed

3. **Check Middleware Order**:

   - Verify `logActivity()` is applied to CRUD routes
   - Ensure `checkUserStatus` runs before `logActivity()`

4. **Check Admin Authentication**:
   - Verify regular admin can perform CRUD operations
   - Check if `req.admin` is properly set

### If Activities Are Logged But Not Displayed:

1. **Check Activity Service**:

   - Verify aggregation pipeline is working
   - Check if superadmin filtering is too aggressive

2. **Check Client-Server Communication**:
   - Check browser network tab for API calls
   - Verify response data structure

## Files to Monitor

### Server Files:

- `Server/src/middleware/activityLogger.js` - Activity logging logic
- `Server/src/middleware/auth.js` - Admin authentication
- `Server/src/models/Activity.js` - Database operations
- `Server/src/service/activityService.js` - Activity filtering
- `Server/src/routes/admin.route.js` - Middleware application

### Client Files:

- `Client/src/services/adminService.ts` - API calls
- `Client/src/pages/admin/ActivityLog.tsx` - Display logic

## Success Criteria

✅ **Test Passes If**:

1. Regular admin can perform CRUD operations
2. All CRUD operations are logged to database
3. Activity logs page shows all regular admin activities
4. Superadmin activities are filtered out from display
5. Search and filtering work properly

❌ **Test Fails If**:

1. CRUD operations are not logged at all
2. Only LOGIN activities are visible
3. Superadmin activities are visible in logs
4. Error messages appear in server console

## Next Steps After Testing

1. **If Test Passes**: Remove debug logs and update documentation
2. **If Test Fails**: Enable debug logs and identify failure point
3. **If Partial Success**: Identify which specific operations are failing

This comprehensive test will help identify exactly where the CRUD logging process is failing and guide the next steps for fixing the issue.
